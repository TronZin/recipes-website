        <h2>About the dish</h2>
            <p>
                Yeah, you've probably seen the "green spaggheti" dish too, theyre not similar at all but the reason
                why their names are so similar is quite intuitive, they have that color yeah, although I could say this
                dish is more like an orange. Mostly made by great moms all around Peru, known for being very popular among
                the pasta dishes in the nation. Be ready, because some of the ingredients are native to Peru so you might
                struggle to get it in your country.

            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    open your veggies et rid of all the stems and seeds, specially in the peruvian chilli, make sure to get
                    rid of all the core 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Chop all your vegetables (onion, tomato, carrot, bell pepper, peruvian chilli, and garlic if necessary)
                    ideally they should be no bigger than a garlic clove.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Put them all in a hot oiled pan and cook until they acquire a slight brownish tone
                </li>
                <li>
                    Start seasoning the chicken to save some time, only salt in this case
                </li>
                <li>      
                    Once the veggies are good, blend them until they acquire a sauce-like consistency, you might
                    have to add some water too
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the same pan, start frying the chicken, you don't need to cook the completely, we will do that later.
                    Focus more on the crust
                </li> 
                <li>
                    Pour te liquid veggies on the pan, you might need to switch pans if yours is not big enough
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the Hongo y Laurel, salt, pepper and msg and put a lit on the pan, set it at low heat and leave for 40 mins
                </li>
                <li>Cook the spaggheti</li>
                <li>On a plate set the spaggheti with the sauce and chicken on top</li>
            </ol>
