            <h2>About the dish</h2>
            <p>
                Dish that might have cuban origins, but for now we will prepare the
                peruvian version usually seen in most households as a casual dish that
                you make when you want a <strong>quick, cheap and amazing</strong> meal for lunch.
            </p>


            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 or 2 Eggs per person</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of rice per person</li>
                <li>1 Ripe Planton per 2 people</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>First of all, we will cook the rice, you can use any style but its preferible
                    to do it the asian way plus some oil and salt to get that peruvian touch
                </li>
                <li>While our rice cooks, we will carefully peel and vertically slice the planton 
                    (we want something similar to strips) here some tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>First vertically cut the platon right in the middle</li>
                        <li>Now cut each part horizontally so that we get 3 slices per chunk (6 in total)</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Now ww will fry and season the eggs in any style and point we like, try not to go
                    for scrambled eggs otherwise you will lose some of that peruvian style.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After you're done with your eggs, you're gonna add and heat some extra oil to the pan to
                    parcially submerge the planton slices, theyre not that tall so you might not need much
                </li>
                <li>Fry the plantons until they acquire a brownish tone on the borders</li>
                <li>Get all your ingredients and put them on a plate, rice first, then the egg, and planton on the side to get that peruvian effext</li> 
            </ol>

            <em>Enjoy your meal :)</em>
